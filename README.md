## 1. Introduction
This project is designed to act as an introduction into financial modelling and time series analysis. It will use a ml researcher approach in that a large portion of this will be a research based approach and not just making and producing the model. The project will consist of 8 key phases totalling around 16 weeks and will roughly consist of the following;

* Phase 1: Foundational Understanding and Problem Formulation (Weeks 1-2)
* Phase 2: Data Acquisition and Preprocessing (Week 3)
* Phase 3: In-depth Exploritory Data Analysis & Feature Engineering (Weeks 4-5)
* Phase 4: Model Selection and Deep Dive (Weeks 6-9)
* Phase 5: Training, Validation and Testing Strategy (Week 10)
* Phase 6: Model Implementation, Training and Hyperparameter Tuning (Weeks 11-13)
* Phase 7: Results, Comparison & Critical Analysis (Weeks 14-15)
* Phase 8: Conclusions and Future Work (Week 16)

## 2.0 Research
The research chapter contains all of the key elements and areas of interest that arise during the project. This will cover all aspects of both finance and ml (including core mathematics). This will be used as a guide and can be referred back if needed.
